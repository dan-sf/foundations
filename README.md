Foundations
===========

This is an example repository with basic infrastructure setups for various tech
stacks that I'm interested in, or working with. I would like to think of these
infrastructures as starting points for larger projects, and general
education/exploration of common infrastructure combinations. Basically, they
are hello world setups for various tech stacks.

None of these examples are meant for production and mostly use Docker and
`docker-compose` to spin various containers up locally. Each sub-folder will
have more info about the projects within.
